     <h1>About Webapp</h1>
    <h2>Hello and welcome, Actully the story of this website begans couple of years ago, when i started my investing joureny.
    I know know you must be thinking "couple of years ago, which means in 2022, so you missed the after covid bull run of 2021?" yes thats true.
    so when i started investing it was the end of the bull run and market was going into the bear fase and i was buying on the dips.
and making continious losses. At that time to measure some parameters regarding my portfolio, i started making some simple calculators.
excel was and is not my favourite thing. so instead of that i wrote these formulas in c and c++ and made some basic console app for my own use.
But when i began to learn web development, its abviousli first thing come to my mind that to make these calculators available for everybody.
Thats when working on this web app began.<br> </h2>
<h2>Here i have integrated several calculaters which you can use to measure some basic things such as average value of share, contribution of stock in your portfolio etc;<br>
<ol>
    <li>Stock Contribution Calculator: This calculator will help you to find percent contribution of any stock in your portfolio.</li><br>
    <li>Stock Average Calculator (basic): In this calculator you can find what is the average stock price you are going to get after reinvestment.</li><br>
    <li>Stock Average Calculator (advance): In this calculator, with average stock price you can get percent net change as well</li><br>
    <li>Percent Change Calculator: In this calculator you can find percent change between two points.</li><br>
